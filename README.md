## serverMonitor

A simple Node app that checks in with a list of servers once a minute and reports on the status in a single page app.

#### How to configure

You have to modify the source code to configure this app.

In servermonitor.js, set urlServerList to point to your server list.

Set s3statspath to point to the S3 location that you want the stats to be saved at.

#### Why is this so hard to configure?

I'm basically using GitHub as a backup. 

This isn't a supported tool. I figure there are already plenty of ways to monitor the status of server apps. This is the one I like to run. Probably not a big deal.
